marioAi is an AI model trained to play the Mario game

## Description

This is a deep learning model using Gym open source and PPO algorithm to train Mario to play the game and optimize the reward of the game.
With the aim to win the game using the deep learning, I use PPO and GYM since these open source can optimized game training process. However,
with 1 millions run time of training, my model can only go through the first half of the map. Hence if I want to win this game, I have to increase
the data size so that the model can learn the game more precisely.
